<h2 id="general"></h2>
  This course is about analyzing large amounts of quantitative data. The usual goal will be to make a set of decisions. Some terms you may run into include:
  <ul>
    <li>Data mining</li>
    <li>Business analytics, Business intelligence</li>
    <li>Machine learning</li>
    <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
    <li>Big Data</li>
    <li>Specific techniques, such as Classification Trees, Neural Networks, Naive Bayesian, Random Forests, State Vector Machines, and many others.</li>
  </ul>
<p>

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who should take this course?</strong>
  This course is for students who want to understand how to use new analytic concepts, often referred to as &ldquo;data mining&rdquo; or &ldquo;big data,&rdquo; to understand and solve problems. The problem
  domain will be mainly business, with some public health and other non-monetary issues. The course is about the entire cycle of problem solving, from selecting the problem to presenting the results in an understandable way, and putting them into action. Business problems will include
  web analytics, marketing, operations, etc.
  <br>
  Language and prerequisites: We will use primarily the R language, a computer language designed for statistical computing. Applying data mining methods, understanding their strengths/weaknesses, and using the results will be emphasized over statistical theory and computer science. A good background in statistics is required, especially a thorough understanding of classical least squares regression. Therefore IRCO 454 or equivalent are a prerequisite. You also need some background in computer programming/number crunching, sufficient to figure out R using the many on-line classes, videos, and guides. (Some are mentioned later in this syllabus.)
  Programming is a perverse art, requiring constant inquisitiveness, a healthy amount of paranoia, and willingness to experiment.

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<p>
  Here is an approximate schedule. Normally, <strong>problem sets are due on Sunday</strong>. Mondays will be used for lectures, and Wednesdays will introduce new methods. Daily assignments will be posted on Ted. The final column shows deliverables for the projects. <strong>A project memorandum is due each Wednesday</strong> starting January 13. These memos wonâ€™t always be returned; keep working, regardless.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
